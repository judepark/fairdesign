My Mantra for this Research...

1. I will <u>not</u> park my identity at the door. (I will not hide, avert, avoid or disguise marginal experiences, including my own.)
2. I will share experiences of bias, discrimination, prejudice, neglect and microaggressions without shame or fear of retribution. 
3. To operate on the basis that there is always room for improvement - No one is complete in our path towards progress (social or design).
