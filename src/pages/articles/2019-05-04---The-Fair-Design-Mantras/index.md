I as a Designer, will include the experiences of marginalized groups into my design process.

I shall not hide, avoid or diminish experiences of others, but integrate identities of people different from me into my work.

In order to create a seamless digital product and service that do not discriminate, bias or neglect,

I will advocate for the user in all their diversity.

With my seat at the table, I will bring voices that can empower companies to make inclusive and smart decisions. 

[SIGNATURE]
