Reading Beverly Daniel Tatu's "Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together at the Cafeteria?" was an extremly interesting experience. Not only did for the first time in my life had an academic explaining in clear words what microaggresion that I experienced as a person of color was in empirical terms, but it was also interesting to watch various people's reactio to me reading a book with the title "Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together at the Cafeteria?". More than once, I got glances and raised eyebrows from fellow commuters or people in the office.
