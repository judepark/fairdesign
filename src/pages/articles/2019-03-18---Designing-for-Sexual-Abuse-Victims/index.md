A question came to me in light of allegations against celebrities who sexually abuse their victims. From Harvey Weinstein to Bill Cosby, from R. Kelly to Michael Jackson, the social discussions surrounding powerful men and their crimes has been very revealing in the last couple of years. 

One thing that is consistently true across all these stories is that victims often choose silence. And we know from empirical research how damaging that silence can be for the victims, years and decades following the event. Sometimes their whole lives.  

Technology offers people instant reach to others, and can help encourage them to share their stories annonymously. 

So how do we design channels that are safe, free from judgement, and offers support and aid for those who have suffered or is suffering from sexual abuse?

##The Scope of My Research Question
I don't want to focus on proving or disproving sexual abuse, because the process to validate one's abuse is incredibly stressful for the victims. 

##Competitive analysis or Environmental Scan or What is Out there Now


##What Sexual Abuse Is
* Your brain physically is changed from abuse
* They canâ€™t give a straight answer because we as society is not dealt or equipped to handle grey - sexual abuse/seduction does not feel black and white, right or wrong to both the perpetrator and the victim.
* You can feel good from the sex, even as a victim (this is a powerful part)
