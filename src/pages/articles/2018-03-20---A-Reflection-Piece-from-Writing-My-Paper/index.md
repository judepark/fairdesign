description: "A Reflection Piece - from Writing My Paper"
---

In the stress of finishing all my projects for my final term in my User Experience Program, of all the projects the one I am currently struggling with most is my Paper for the course that I designed myself, Fair Design.

In writing this paper, I had come to face the inevitable fact that I may have been avoiding: Fair Design as a concept is almost never-ending, and there is so much work to be done.

For my paper I researched all previously existing design methodologies, and I also have to face some redundencies and similarities across the varied design principles.

Universal Design, Inclusive Design, Accessibility Design, Participatory Design, Design Thinking, Service Design - These all design methodologies that aim to solve a common problem - the usablity of products.

I find myself becoming exhausted from so much work. If anyone is out there who is willing to help me research this topic, I am more than open to hearing you, who ever you are, where ever you are.

Perhaps this is the rampblings of a overstressed, overworked masters student at 3am in the morning. Or there may be some grain of truth to it - that there is so much work lef to do for Fair Design, if we want to design a world that is fairer, for tomorrow.
