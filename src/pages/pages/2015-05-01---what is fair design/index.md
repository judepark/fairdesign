##Introduction

Fair Design was conceptualized during my masters education, when as a young UX designer I noticed a lack of discipline and pedagogies aimed at educating designers on how to create digital experiences for users with marginalized identities.

Design produced by designers who lack awareness or interest in the users' accessibility needs often leads to failures. To design without understanding social privileges of the target user groups ultimately leads to prejudiced or discriminatory design (or simply, bad design). 

What seperates Fair Design from other design frameworks is the measurement of the users' proximity to information by considering the privileges of the target user group in the design process. Fair Design aims to answer the question "Is this design fair for all intended users?".

Fair Design is built upon the frameworks of <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/accessibility" title="Interaction Design Foundation's Definition of Accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accessibility Design</a> (*Designing for Disability*), <a href="https://idrc.ocadu.ca/" title="OCAD's Inclusive Design Centre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inclusive Design</a> (*Designing for Diversity*) and <a href="http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/" title="National Disability Authority's Definition of Universal Design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Design</a> (*Designing for All*). Fair Design also adopts mandates from design activisms groups across the globe, to understand specific needs of social groups and address their needs.
