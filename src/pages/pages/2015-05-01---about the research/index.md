This is a research blog on design biases and discrimination, and how designers can avoid them in their process. 

Browse and contribute to this collaborative body of research that aims to improve our awareness on marginalized users and experiences. We hope to proactively prepare for a future that is inclusive, accessible and fair to all, by exploring and learning from each other. 

We accept all submissions that explores the theme of equity, ethics and fairness in technological innovations. 

####To contribute, please email your submissions to <a href="mailto:jude@judepark.com" title="Jude's Email" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**Jude Park**</a>.

 
####I vow as a fair design researcher...

1. I will <u>not</u> park my identity at the door. (I will not hide, avert, avoid or disguise marginal experiences, including my own.)
2. To operate on the basis that there is always room for emprovement - No one is complete in our path towards progress, whether that is social or design process. 
3. For the purpose of learning from one another, I will share experiences of bias, discrimination, neglect and microaggressions without shame and/or fear of retribution.
