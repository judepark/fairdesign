This is a research blog for Fair Design, a design methodology that aims to eliminate bias and/or discrimination in the design industry.

Browse and contribute to this collaborative body of research that aims to improve our awareness on how design can affect marginalized groups of people. We hope to proactively prepare for a future that is inclusive to all, by exploring users and contexts that design has failed to reach before.

We accept all submissions that explores the theme of fairness in technological innovations.
