This is a research blog on technology and equity.

I am a User Experience + Inclusion Expert, and I write about design biases and discrimination, and how designers can avoid them in their process.

This body of work aims to contribute to our collective awareness of marginalized users and experiences. The goal of this research is to proactively prepare for a future that is inclusive, accessible and fair to all, by trying to answer what is fair in design and human use of technological innovations. 

If you inquire about the research or would like to get involved, please contact [fairdesignresearch@gmail.com](mailto:fairdesignresearch@gmail.com).
